# Toffeed (no News Feed)
Toffeed is a wrapper for Facebook's mobile site that provides enhancements to the normal browser experience. **This is a modded version that hides the News Feed and instead redirects the user to their Notifications at the start of the app.**

You can't get to the News Feed, there is no switch for enabling it, no hidden link, nothing - a perfect option if you hate loosing time mindlessly scrolling through it, but you realise you're doing it half an hour too late!

##How to install

You can clone the repo and build it yourself ;)

If you don't want to build the APK on your own, the bulids are available [in the release directory](https://github.com/z-gora/Toffeed/tree/master/release).

You can find the original Toffeed repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/JakeLane/Toffeed).

The original Toffeed is currently available [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.jakelane.wrapperforfacebook) on Google Play.
